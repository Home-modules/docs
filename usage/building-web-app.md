# Home_modules web app building guide

1. Make sure you have Node.JS (v14 or higher) and NPM (v7 or higher) installed.
2. Clone the web app repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Home-modules/webapp.git
   cd webapp
   ```

   > **Note**  
   > The version of the hub and the web app must be the same, otherwise the web app will either show an error or crash.

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the app

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   OR run the app in development mode

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
